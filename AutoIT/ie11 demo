;Okay, I think I fixed it after I noticed the failed computer seems to be faster than the one it doesn't fail:
;Added a delay (i.e. Sleep($delayFactor)) before and after any calls made to IE.au3 functions
;Added a MsgBox(0, "", "Stop before _IENavigate()!", 1) before any _IENavigate() calls
;For the 2nd point, I can't use Sleep(1000) to replace the MsgBox() call to fix it.
;I know, it's weird, but it seems to work here.:sweating:
